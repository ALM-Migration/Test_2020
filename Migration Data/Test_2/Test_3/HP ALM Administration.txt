HP ALM Administration: Create Domain, Project & User
In order to work with ALM, you need to

Create Domain
Create Project
Create Users
In practice, these would be created by ALM Site Administrator as an end user WILL NOT have access to Site Admin page.

 

 

How to Create a Domain
Step 1) Launch ALM and click 'Site administration' from the home page. User will be popped up to enter the credentials. Enter the Credentials that we have created during Installation.

Step 4) Select the appropriate Database type and enter the following. In this case, we have selected 'MS-SQL' as we had installed Hp-ALM with MS-SQL as backend. If you had installed ALM with Oracle as your database server, please select 'oracle'.

(1) Database server name

(2) Database Admin User Name

(3) Database Admin Password and click 'Next'.

Step 6) The summary dialog is displayed and Click on 'create' button. You will also notice that there are two check boxes in this window.

Activate Project – If unchecked, project would still be created but users will not be able to access this project area.

Enable Versioning – This will enable version controlling feature which restricts the users from editing the same work item (requirements, tests) at the same time to avoid overwriting the changes made by one user over other.

Step 4) Now we will need to map the user to the project areas as the newly created user WILL NOT have access to any of the projects. It is enough to create a user only once to have access to multiple project areas.

In this case we have added the user 'Guru99' to 'GURU99_BANK' Project area which is under 'BANKING' domain.
