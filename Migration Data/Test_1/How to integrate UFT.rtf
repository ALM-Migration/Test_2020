\par
Part C \endash  Saving Script into ALM\par
Let us understand the various components that are required for Executing an UFT Script.\par
Main Driver Script \endash  The Entry point for any UFT Script that has .mts extension.\par
Library \endash  The relevant Script/Function Files that can either be of extension (.vbs) or (.qfl).\par
Object Repository \endash  It is usually of Shared Object repository by nature and has .tsr extension.\par
DataTable \endash  Used for parameterizing the tests. Usually an Excel file.\par
Note: The Idea behind this chapter is to understand ALM and UFT integration and NOT to learn how to write UFT scripts.\par
\par
How to integrate UFT(QTP) with  ALM (Quality Center)\par
\par
Step 1) First step is to save the Main Driver Script into ALM from UFT. Navigate to 'File' Menu and choose 'New Test' as shown below.\par
\par
