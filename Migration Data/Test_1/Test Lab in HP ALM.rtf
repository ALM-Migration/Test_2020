Once the test design is completed, test execution will take place with the help of Test Lab module.\par
One common term you will come across in HP ALM in the Test Set module of Test Lab. If your mind triggers images of some sort of collection or a set, you are correct. Test Set is infact a collection of test cases that we intend to execute.\par
Test cases from the Test Plan module are called into the Test Lab module.\par
Changes done to test cases in the Test Lab module do not affect the parent test cases in Test Plan Module. You are free to experiment. Hence the name Test Lab!\par
It is better to give the test set name same as that of the module name so that all the tests within the module are contained in same test set which would be easy to execute and track.\par
Each test set folder is assigned to a particular cycle. This enables users to group the tests together that will be executed in a particular cycle.\par
This module also helps user to track the progress of the cycle as the tests are executed.\par
The Test Lab module consists of the following functionalities and let us understands each one of those in detail.\par

How to Create a Test Set\par
Step 1) First step is to create a root folder as a container for having the test sets. We can name it in line with the release and cycle so that it is easy to track.\par
\par
Goto 'Test Lab' Module under 'Testing' Tab\par
Create a new Folder by Clicking on 'New Folder' icon.\par
The 'New Test Set Folder' Dialog opens. Enter the name of the folder as '2017 R1 \f1\endash  Cycle 1'.\par
Click 'Ok'\par
Working with Test Lab in HP ALM\par
\par
Step 2) The Test Run Folder would be created as shown below.\par
\par
Working with Test Lab in HP ALM\par
\par
Step 3) Select the created folder and assign 'Cycle' to it which means the entire test set should be executed for Cycle 1.\par
\par
Working with Test Lab in HP ALM\par
\par
Step 4) Enter the name of test set and click 'OK'\par
\par
Note: The Target Cycle field is disabled as the target cycle is selected at the folder level(2017 R1 \endash  Cycle 1).\par
\par
Working with Test Lab in HP ALM\par
\par
Step 5) After creating the test set, we need to select the tests and add it to the test set. \par
\par
Select the Test Set.\par
Navigate to 'Execution Grid'.\par
Click 'Select Tests' Button. The Test Plan Tree opens up.\par
Select the Tests to be executed for this Cycle.\par
Click '<=' button. This will move/pull test cases from test plan to test lab.\par
Working with Test Lab in HP ALM\par
\par
Step 6) Upon adding tests from test plan tree, all the configuration parameters of the selected tests are displayed to the user. User can edit the configuration before adding it to the test lab.\par
\par
Note: User has no control over test configuration selection in test Lab. Hence the entire configuration will be added to the test set by default. In case one of the selected configuration is NOT part of the cycle, after adding the tests, delete from the test lab.\par
\par
Working with Test Lab in HP ALM\par
\par
Step 7) After selecting the configurations, the selected tests are added to the test set. In this case we have selected all three configurations; hence we can find three instances of '01- Login Test'.\par
\par
Working with Test Lab in HP ALM\par
\par
Step 8) Repeat the above steps to create more test sets and select all the relevant tests planned for this cycle. After creating all test set, the structure of test set will be as shown below:\par
\par
Working with Test Lab in HP ALM\par
\par
Step 9) The other important tab that we need to understand is 'Execution Flow'. Select 'Execution Flow Tab' which displays the order in which the tests would display during the execution. Users can also change the execution order using this tab which will be dealt in a separate section of this module.\par
\par
Working with Test Lab in HP ALM\par
\par
How to Execute Tests\par
Step 1) Created test sets are now ready for execution. Tests can be executed using two options.\par
\par
Run Test Set \endash  This option allows user to execute all the tests in a selected test set.\par
Run \endash  This option helps user to execute just the selected test.\par
Working with Test Lab in HP ALM\par
\par
Step 2) Let us execute the entire test suite of the Login module by selecting 'Run Test Set' option. Upon clicking 'Run Test set' it displays the user with two options.\par
\par
Manual Runner (default) \endash  The order of the tests displayed during the execution would be as that of the order that is displayed in the test set grid.\par
Automatic Runner \endash  The order of the tests displayed during execution would be shown as that of the order set in the execution flow tab.\par
Let us proceed with the default option.\par
\par
Working with Test Lab in HP ALM\par
\par
Step 3) The Manual Test runner is displayed to the User. In this Dialog let us understand the important features.\par
\par
Begin Run \endash  Helps to kick start the execution\par
End Run \endash  Terminates the current Execution and closes the manual runner.\par
Cancel Run \endash  Cancels the execution of the current tests.\par
Attachments \endash  Helps us to attach screenshot/any other information related to the this test execution\par
New Defect \endash  Upon clicking on it new defects dialog opens using which a Defect can be posted.\par
OS Info \endash  Gives information about the operating system in which the tests are executed.\par
Run Name \endash  Unique Time stamp using which the test results can be analyzed at later point in time.\par
Click 'Begin Run'.\par
\par
Working with Test Lab in HP ALM\par
\par
Step 4) Manual test runner with test controls and steps are displayed to the user. Let us understand the functionalities available in this test runner dialog.\par
\par

\par
How to create Test Run Schedule\par
Testers can control the test execution with the help of "Execution Flow" Tab. Testers can also specify date and time for executing a particular test instance. We can also schedule the test based on the results of another specified test instance in the Execution Flow.\par
\par
Now, let us understand how to schedule the test flow in HP-ALM.\par
\par
Step 1) Select "Execution Flow" tab from Test Lab module.\par
\par
Working with Test Lab in HP ALM\par
\par
Step 2) Double click on the specific test against which the schedule needs to be set. "Test Run Schedule" would be displayed as shown below. We can notice that there are no execution conditions that were set by default.\par
\par
Working with Test Lab in HP ALM\par
\par
Step 3) To Add an execution condition, click on "+" icon as shown below.\par
\par
Working with Test Lab in HP ALM\par
\par
Step 4) The New execution condition dialog opens up.\par
\par
Select the test from test drop down. All the tests in the test set will be displayed\par
Select the condition. It can take either 'Passed' or 'Finished'.\par
Click 'OK'.\par
Working with Test Lab in HP ALM\par
\par
Step 5) The test run schedule is displayed with the added execution conditions.\par
\par
Working with Test Lab in HP ALM\par
\par
Step 6) The Execution flow realigns automatically as show below. According to the below displayed flow, the test 'Cluster Head' will be executed only when the '02 \endash  Reset Button Check' is finished.\par
\par
Working with Test Lab in HP ALM\par
\par
Step 7) Nowlet us understand how testers can specify the date and time in execution flow for executing a particular test. It is more helpful when testers know about the readiness of a specific functionality or for scheduling automated tests.\par
\par
Let us say, the manager login profile would be ready only after a specific date. Hence testers can execute the same by specifying the conditions in 'Execution Flow'.\par
\par
Double Click on the test for which the execution flow criteria needs to be set.\par
\par
Working with Test Lab in HP ALM\par
\par
Step 8) Now,\par
\par
Navigate to 'Time Dependancy' Module\par
Select 'Run at Specified Time'\par
Enter the Date on which you would like to execute\par
Enter the Time when you would like to execute the test\par
Click 'Ok'.\par
Working with Test Lab in HP ALM\par
\par
Step 9) Theexecution flow tab will be realigned as shown below. This kind of scheduling is very much helpful for automated tests which follow the same steps.\par
\par
Note: Ifthe scheduled date and time has arrived, then ALM would automatically launch the tests. It holds good for automated test as test would be executed without any manual intervention. The Precondition for triggering the tests automatically is that the host should be ready(shouldn't be powered off or locked) and it should be in a state to trigger the test. If it is a manual test then there won't be any effect.\par
\par

\par
How to Analyze Test Result\par
Step 1) Once the test execution is done, testers can view the results in the "Test Runs" module. It contains the results of test instance runs and test set runs.\par
\par
Goto "Test Runs" in "Testing" Tab and the window opens as shown below:\par
The Run Name is a unique value generated for each one of those test executions.\par
'Status' shows the final status of the test execution.\par
The detailed Result can be viewed by clicking on the 'Run ID'.\par
\par
Working with Test Lab in HP ALM\par
\par
Step 2) The Run details dialog opens up and user will be able to view the detailed result.\par
\par
Goto 'Report' tab of the 'Run Details' window.\par
Testers can check the status of each one of those test steps.\par
Click 'Ok' to close the dialog.\par

 \par
\par
points to remember:\par
\par
You will use the Test Lab module in QualityCenter to execute your test cases\par
Before you begin execution , you need to create a "Test Set Tree"\par
To create a Test Set Tree , you need to first create  a "Test Set Folder"\par
Next, you will  add "Tests" created in the Test Plan Module, to your Test Set Folder.\par
A Test Set Folder together with added Tests is called the Test Set Tree (since it looks like a tree structure.)\par
Test sets can include both manual and automated Test .\par
You can include the same Test  in different Test Sets or add multiple instances of a Test to the same Test Set.\par
Quality Center also provides for scheduling where in you can specify the date and time of execution of your Test Sets.\f0\par
