\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\f0\fs22\lang9 Defect Management Life Cycle in HP ALM (Quality Center)\par
A Defect is logged during the test execution, when expected result and actual result don't match with each other.\par
Defect module in HP ALM not only helps users to post the defects but also enables them to track and gives the overall quality of the release at any stage of the development process.\par

\par
Status\tab Explanation\par
New\tab When a defect is posted, the default status is 'New'\par
Open\tab When the defect is accepted by developers it is moved to 'Open' Status\par
Rejected\tab When the defect is rejected by developers it is moved to 'Rejected' Status\par
Fixed\tab When the defect is fixed by developers it is moved to 'Fixed' Status. Testers would pick up all defects for Testing that are in status 'Fixed'.\par
Reopen\tab If the testing has failed, the defect is moved to 'Reopen' status\par
Closed\tab If the testing has passed, the defect is moved to 'Closed' Status.\par
Note:\par
\par
Users can also configure the defect life cycle by adding new defect statuses. Adding new defect status would be dealt in project customization chapter.\par

\par
How to Link Defect to a Requirement\par
Users can link a defect with other defects or link a defect with requirements. By Linking defects and requirement we can generate coverage analysis graph and traceability matrix.\par
\par
Step 1) After creating the defect, testers can map the linked requirements against it. To do the same,\par
\par
Click on 'Defect ID'\par
The defect details dialog opens as shown below.\par
Defect Management in HP ALM (Quality Center)\par
\par
Step 2) To Link entities,\par
\par
Navigate to 'Linked Entities'\par
Click 'Others' for linking requirements against this defect.\par
Click 'Link' button and choose 'by Id'(we can also select based on a requirement name)\par
Enter the Requirement ID against which this defect has to be mapped.\par
Click 'Link' Button\par
Defect Management in HP ALM (Quality Center)\par
\par
Step 3) After clicking link button the defect details window displayed back to the user with the added link as shown below.\par
\par
Defect Management in HP ALM (Quality Center)\par
\par
Step 4) Once the requirement is linked against a defect, the requirement displays with the link symbol against it as shown below.\par
\par
Defect Management in HP ALM (Quality Center)\par
\par
Step 5) Once the requirement is linked against a defect, the requirement Traceability Matrix can be generated. To generate the Traceability Matrix navigate to view menu of 'Requirements' and select 'Traceability matrix'. The generated Traceability Matrix would be generated as shown below.\par
\par
Note: Please refer the tutorial 'Requirements Module' for generating traceability matrix where the steps are elaborated in detail.\par

How to Upload Defect using Excel\par
Every time users won't be in position to create each one of those defects manually.\par
This module helps users to upload the defects from Excel into ALM. This really helps when users want to migrate from one defect management system to ALM.\par
The process remains the same as that of uploading Tests and requirements.\par
One has to ensure that the Excel file is prepared in a format such that ALM allows importing of the data.\par
Step 1) Create the Excel file with the required columns that user wishes to upload as shown below.\par
\par
The Field 'attachments' takes the local path where the screenshot/any other attachment is kept. Users have to just mention the path of the attachment so that it would be picked up for uploading into ALM along with the other details of the defect.\par
\par

\par
Step 2) Now,\par
\par
Navigate to 'Add-ins' Tab\par
Select 'Export to HP ALM'\par
Defect Management in HP ALM (Quality Center)\par
\par
Step 3) The ALM Export Wizard opens. Enter the HP ALM Server URL and Click 'Next'.\par
\par

\par
Step 6) Select the type of data that we would like to upload. In this case, it is Defects.\par
\par
Defect Management in HP ALM (Quality Center)\par
\par
Step 7) Enter the New Map name. The first option, 'Select a map' is disabled because we haven't created a map so far for uploading defects. Hence we should create new map name and click 'Next'. We haven't selected 'Create a Temporary map' as we would like to reuse every time for uploading defects.\par
\par
Defect Management in HP ALM (Quality Center)\par
\par
Step 8) Upon Clicking 'Next', the mapping dialog opens as shown below.\par
\par
The left pane grid items that are listed correspond to the fields that are available for upload in HP ALM. Please note that the fields marked in 'RED' should be mapped as they are mandatory fields.\par
The right pane grid items refer to the fields that are mapped so that values in Excel will flow into those corresponding fields of ALM.\par
Defect Management in HP ALM (Quality Center)\par
\par
Step 9) Now let us understand how to map the fields in Excel against the fields in ALM.\par
\par
Select the Field that user would like to map and click on the arrow button as shown below.\par
Defect Management in HP ALM (Quality Center)\par
\par
Enter the column name in Excel that corresponds to the appropriate column name in HP ALM.\par
Defect Management in HP ALM (Quality Center)\par
\par
Map all the required columns in Excel against the appropriate fields in HP ALM. After mapping all the required fields, click 'Export'.\par
Defect Management in HP ALM (Quality Center)\par
\par
Step 10) Upon successful upload, ALM displays the message as shown below.\par
\par

\par
How to search a Defect\par
The Defect module contains all the defects that are logged right from the very first defect it has been logged.\par
\par
Hence user would be in a position to search defects based on certain criteria.\par
\par
Step 1) Navigate to 'Edit' Menu and choose 'Find'.\par
\par
Defect Management in HP ALM (Quality Center)\par
\par
Step 2) TheFind dialog would be displayed.\par
\par
Enter the Field name based on which the search has to be performed ( In this case we use Defect ID to search)\par
Enter the Value\par
Click 'Find Next'\par
Defect Management in HP ALM (Quality Center)\par
\par
Step 3) ALM displays the item in the background as shown below.\par
\par

\par
Email Notification of Defects\par
Assigned users will automatically receive an email if there is a change in status/assigned to fields, provided the email configurations are set appropriately by ALM admin\par
The Email would be triggered based on setting under 'Alerts' tab of project customization module (refer to Project Customization for details).\par
Let us say the assigned user 'Glenn' has to receive email when the defect status moved to 'Fixed' status. The email would be sent as shown in the below. The screenshot is taken after receiving an email (from MS Outlook).\par
\par
The mail is sent to 'Glenn'\par
The mail has the details about the defect\par
The mail is triggered because the status has moved from 'Reopen' to 'Fixed' as shown below.\par

Summary:-\par
\par
You can link a test in your Test Plan ,to a specific defect in the Defects Grid ,inQualityCenter\par
Linkage is helpful when new test is created for a existing defect , or there is a change in requirements which is linked to a defect.\par
Linkage can be done  directly or indirectly.\par
When you directly Link a defect to a Run,QualityCenterindirectly links the defect to the Test instance, Test Set , Test and  Requirements\par
However the linkage is unidirectional i.e. when you link a Defect to run , it is not indirectly linked to run step\f0\par
